2. The boyfriend is convinced that his signature was forged on the paternity paper work. 

3. Other problems arise during the trial. The boyfriend has proof of his girlfriend cheating on her. The girlfriend denied it all. 

4. The judge can't handle the couple blaming each other for every little thing. 

5. The judge will now reveal the paternity test.
