Variables are parts of code that hold information. When the computer is told to run a code, the variables are read and calculated.
There are different "types" of variables, such as:

Integral Types : int

Floating Point Types : float and double

Decimal Types : decimal

Boolean Types (bool) : true or false values 

Nullable Types : Nullable data types

Once the type of variable is chosen, it then needs to be declared by giving it a name and date type. The name of a variable
can also be called "identifier". It is best if the identifier is descriptive of the data the variable will contain.
