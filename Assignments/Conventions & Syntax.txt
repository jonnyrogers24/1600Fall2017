Conventions & Syntax

Lets start with conventions.

Conventions are what organizes your code. This can make code easier to read and is put in a simple format that is
usually universal for coders to understand. 

This would include making sure lines are well placed. Another example is indentation. An indentation should be equal for each opening
and closing curly brace, and then further indent for opening and closing curly braces within the previous curly braces.
