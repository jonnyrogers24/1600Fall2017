This .txt file will show what I spent my time doing on Labor Day.

My in-laws drove into Utah from Arizona on Sunday afternoon.

They spent the night with us. 

Labor Day morning I woke up early to drive to Orem to hit the gym with my 2 brothers-in-law
who happen to be twins. It was an intense workout.
