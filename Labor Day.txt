This .txt file will show what I spent my time doing on Labor Day.

My in-laws drove into Utah from Arizona on Sunday afternoon.

They spent the night with us. 

Labor Day morning I woke up early to drive to Orem to hit the gym with my 2 brothers-in-law
who happen to be twins. It was an intense workout.

Afterwards, spent all day at their new BYU on campus apartment helping them settle in their belongings.

That night we ate at Los Hermanos in downtown Provo. 

We accepted the Man vs Nacho Challenge and I failed miserably. I couldn't finish the mountain of nachos.

I felt like gagging.
